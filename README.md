# AcciProof - The Accident Alert System

# Problem Description :-

      * The main agenda behind this project is to minimize the increase in the amount of
      accidents taking place on roadways in our day to day life due to the distraction faced by
      the driver.

      * Many such distractions include - drowsiness, overdrinking, using cell phones , etc.

      * Due to late arrival of ambulances at the accident spot also leads to loss of people's lives.

      * In the remote areas where we don’t have nearby hospitals info due to which many people
      lose their lives.

      * If the driver's condition is very critical then there is no available tool so that someone can
      inform his/her family or friends.
      
      
# Proposed Solution :- 

      ● To solve the above problem we have tried to develop a system which we
      have named as “AcciProof”.
      
      ● In this system there will be two parts where one part will deal with an
      accident-prevention( object detection) system which will alert the driver if
      the driver is feeling sleepy or using the phone while driving.
      
      ● And the other part will serve as life saving which will be a notification
      system that will send alerts to the nearest hospital and driver’s relatives if
      any accident happens.
